## 📌 Objective
To implement a robust and scalable backend module for managing:
- Student invoices
- Installment scheduling
- Payment tracking
- Real-time financial visibility

---

## 🎯 Achievements & Implemented Features

### 1. Invoice Management
- 🔨 Created API to generate invoices for students
- ✅ Supports discounts and calculates due amounts
- ✅ Auto-generates invoice IDs and tracks paid/remaining balances

### 2. Installment Scheduling
- 💡 Auto-generates equal monthly installments based on due amount
- 📆 Calculates installment dates starting from a user-provided start date
- 🧠 Supports future installments and due dates dynamically

### 3. Payment Recording
- ✅ Added API to record payments made toward invoices
- 🧾 Accepts payment mode, UTR number, notes, and amount
- 💰 Updates invoice paid amount and due amount

### 4. Overpayment Protection
- 🛡️ Built-in logic to prevent users from paying more than the actual due
- ⛔ Returns clear error messages if overpayment is attempted

### 5. Auto-Update Installment Status
- 🔄 Automatically marks installments as:
  - `Paid` if fully covered
  - `Partially Paid` if only a part is covered
  - `Pending` if unpaid
- ✅ Works seamlessly during every payment processing

### 6. Installment Tracking APIs
We built and tested three dedicated APIs:

| API                        | Purpose                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| `/installments/pending`   | Lists all unpaid installments|
| `/installments/due-today` | Lists all installments due today|
| `/installments/overdue`   | Lists all past-due installments|

### 7. Timezone Handling
- 🕒 All timestamps (created_at, paid_on) are now converted from UTC to IST using `utc_to_ist()` helper
- ✅ Consistent time visibility across India-based users

### 8. Migration Patch Logic
- ✅ Applied auto-migration to add missing `status` column to `installments` table
- 🧠 No data loss during patch
- 📂 Safe to deploy and re-run

### 9. Postman Testing Completed
All major endpoints tested manually:

- ✅ Invoice creation
- ✅ Installment creation
- ✅ Payment recording
- ✅ Installment tracking (pending, due today, overdue)
- ✅ View payment history
